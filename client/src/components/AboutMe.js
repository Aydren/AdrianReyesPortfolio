      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Throughout my life I have had many dreams. And for as long as I can
        remember, helping people was always what I wanted to do. The only
        problem was, I wasn’t sure ‘How’ I wanted to help people? My initial
        thought was Health Care. Which is what motivated me to go to Nursing
        School, where I became one of only a handful of Dean List students in my
        entire cohort. But even after Nursing School came and went, I realized
        that was not the way I wanted to help people. It wasn’t until the start
        of the covid pandemic that I finally found out how I wanted to help.

        I feel upon a video on youtube about “learning the basics of coding”. I
        remember listening and not understanding anything. My curiosity got the
        better of me, and I fell into a deep rabbit hole. That rabbit hole
        brought me one of greatest gifts I have ever been given. The ’How’ to
        how I wanted to help people. And from that day forward I have been
        working my way to becoming a Software Developer
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since then, I have been working my way to becoming the best Software
        Developer I can be. I have taken 2 Udemy courses on JS and Python and
        have utilized websites such as ‘freecodecamp.org’ to help further my
        knowledge. I attended a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at the University
        of Nevada, Las Vegas, were I have extended my knowledge with HTML, CSS,
        JS, React, MongoDB, etc.. I still have much to learn as I’ve learned
        early on that this career path is one of constant learning.
